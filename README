Ourplace Tintin Scripts

local.tt - Contains #var password ....  This file is not version-controlled.  You must create it in the same directory as your ourplace.tt.  You can also add #var password-<charname> ... for each character, otherwide the default password is used.
ourplace.tt - This is the entry-point script.  It creates an ourplace class that enables various utility functions.  It handles logging and colors as well as global variables used by other scripts.
genae.tt, renae.tt, lenae.tt, denae.tt, gubgub.tt, ddmuleone.tt - These are all character-specific files.  They let you configure character-specific things.
cleric.tt, warrior.tt, necro.tt, thief.tt, etc. - These are class-specific files.  They are included by the character files.  The each contain a spellbook and aliases specific to a class.  You override the common aliases and spellbooks to specifically tailor each class.  The contents of each file follow the same procedure.  They unalias all the common aliases they want to override, then they override them, then they create a class-specific spell book.
slist-aliases.tt - Included by each class-specific file, the contents of this file ensure that aliases and actions are common across all of your characters.  Using the spellup alias, for example, allows every character to use the alias the same way.  By default, there is a set of global variables that you can override in your character-specific files.  For example, the heal alias is defined as '#var heal {tell $cleric heal}'.  If you are a cleric, however, you'd want a different alias:  '#var heal {c heal}'.  You override these aliases in the class-specific files.  You can override the different class variables here or in the character file.
spellbook.tt - This is the actual book of spells for each character.  It generically handles the book, the block list and invocation.
